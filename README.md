Predicting QB Efficiency

  The goal of this project was to predict a quarterback's EPA per Drive using his supporting cast (WR and OL spending) 
as well as his past experience and performance. 

  This github provides the data used in the Rmd file that is the backbone of the rPubs article published on twitter. The link 
to the article that breaks down the model in detail can be found here: https://rpubs.com/PattonAnalytics/QB_EPA
