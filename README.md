Predicting QB Efficiency

  The goal of this project was to predict a QB's EPA per Drive using factors that a QB is tied to (past experience and performance)
as well as team stability and spending (WR and OL).

  This github provides the data used in the Rmd file that built the article that includes full details of the model. The link to the
